            <h3>The Premise</h3>
            <p1>
                This is a silly little website to help you figure out what type you <span class='ghost'>(or your cat)</span> are.
                It uses <a href="https://pokeapi.co/"><span class='electric'>PokeAPI</span></a> to get random PokeDex descriptions, which you can vote how much they relate.
                After voting for a while, or after 80 questions, the types will be ranked in order of how much they match your answers.
            </p1>
            <br><br>
            <h3>How is this scored</h3>
            <p1>
                Scores for types are determined as a percentage range from <span class='fighting'>0.00%</span> to <span class='grass'>100.00%</span>.
                A score of <span class='grass'>100.00%</span> means that all your answers strongly agreed with each example of that type.
                A score of <span class='fighting'>0.00%</span> means that all your answers strongly disagreed with each example of that type.
                Each type starts out with a score of <span class='ground'>50.00%</span> (Neutral), and is influenced from there by your answers.
            </p1>
            <br><br>
            <h3>Specifics</h3>
            <p1>
                If you want to know about the specifics, each score is calculated by taking the sum of your answers on a type,
                dividing it by the total number of answers on that type, and mapping it to a percentage.<br><br>
                <u>For example:</u><br>
                On my first question, I vote "strongly agree" on a <span class='grass'>grass type</span> question (+2).
                My answer sum for grass goes from 0 to 2. My total answers for <span class='grass'>grass type</span> goes from 0 to 1.
                My score for <span class='grass'>grass type</span> can be calculated as <span class='psychic'>2 / 1 = 2</span>, or 100% on the scale from -2 to 2.
                If I then vote for another <span class='grass'>grass type</span>, but only "mostly agree" (+1), this changes:<br>
                My answer sum for <span class='grass'>grass type</span> goes from 2 to 3. My total answers for <span class='grass'>grass type</span> goes from 1 to 2.
                My score will then be <span class='psychic'>3 / 2 = 1.5</span>, or 87.5% on the scale from -2 to 2.
